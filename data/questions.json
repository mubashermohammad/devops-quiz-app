    "options": [
      "To replace developers with operations staff",
      "To create a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams",
      "To eliminate the need for testing",
      "To automate all manual processes without planning"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "DevOps is fundamentally about collaboration and integration between development and operations teams. By breaking down traditional silos between these teams, DevOps enables faster software delivery, more reliable systems, and faster problem resolution. The key is collaboration, not replacing one team with another."

    "question": "Which of the following is a core principle of DevOps?",
    "options": [
      "Siloed teams and separate responsibilities",
      "Continuous improvement and shared responsibility",
      "Manual processes and minimal automation",
      "Avoiding communication between teams"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "DevOps emphasizes continuous improvement (Kaizen), shared responsibility for outcomes, and breaking down organizational silos. Rather than development and operations teams working in isolation, DevOps encourages shared goals, mutual accountability, and regular communication to deliver better software faster."

      "Code quality",
      "Time to market and deployment failures",
      "Developer productivity"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "DevOps focuses on reducing two critical metrics: (1) the time between code development and production deployment (time to market), and (2) the number of failed deployments and system failures. By automating processes and improving collaboration, DevOps enables more frequent, reliable deployments."

      "Keeping operational knowledge secret",
      "Minimizing communication between teams"
    ],
    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Blameless post-mortems are critical to DevOps culture. When incidents occur, the focus is on understanding what went wrong and how to prevent it, not on blaming individuals. This psychological safety encourages teams to report issues quickly and share knowledge, leading to continuous improvement."

    "answerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Version Control Systems (VCS) serve three critical functions: (1) Track all code changes and their history, (2) Enable multiple developers to collaborate without overwriting each other's work, and (3) Provide the ability to revert to previous versions if needed. This is fundamental to professional software development."
